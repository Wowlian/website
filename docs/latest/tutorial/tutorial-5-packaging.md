Electron does not have any tooling for packaging and distribution bundled into its core
modules. Once you have a working Electron app in development mode, you need to use
additional tooling to create a packaged app you can distribute to your users (also known
as a **distributable**). Distributables can be either installers (e.g. MSI on Windows) or
portable executable files (e.g. `.zip` on macOS).

In this section, we'll be going over the basics of packaging your app with
[Electron Forge].

## Importing your project into Electron Forge

First, add Electron Forge as a development dependency of your app and use its `import`
command to scaffold your existing app into a Forge project:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli
npx electron-forge import
```

Once the conversion script is done, Forge should have added a few scripts
to your `package.json` file.

```json title='package.json' {5}
  //...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron-forge start",
    "package": "electron-forge package",
    "make": "electron-forge make"
  },
  //...
```

:::info CLI documentation
For more information on `make` and other Forge commands, check out
the [Electron Forge CLI documentation].
:::

You should also notice that your `package.json` now has a few more packages installed
under your dev dependencies, and contains an added `config.forge` field with an array
of `makers` configured. **Makers** are Forge plugins that create distributables from
your source code. You should see multiple Makers in the default

## Creating a distributable

To create a distributable, use Forge's `make` script:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run make
```

After the script runs, you should see `out` folder containing both the packaged
application in folder format and the distributable:

```plain title='macOS output example'
out/
├── out/make/zip/darwin/x64/my-electron-app-darwin-x64-1.0.0.zip
├── ...
└── out/my-electron-app-darwin-x64/my-electron-app.app/Contents/MacOS/my-electron-app
```

The distributable in the `out/make` folder should be ready to launch! You have now
created your first full-fledged Electron application.

:::tip Distributable formats
Electron Forge can be configured to create distributables in different OS-specific formats
(e.g. DMG, deb, MSI, etc.). See Forge's [Makers] documentation for all configuration options.

guide.

## Important: signing your code

In order to distribute desktop applications to end users, we _highly recommended_ for you
to **code sign** your Electron app.

Code signing is a security technology that you use to certify that a desktop app was
created by a known source. Windows and macOS have their own OS-specific code signing
systems that will make it difficult for users to download or launch unsigned applications.

Please see the full [Code Signing] guide for more information.
