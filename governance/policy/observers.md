# Observers

## Definitions

**Sponsor:** A Working Group in Electron Governance or a company represented in a Working Group wishing to introduce an Observer into their Working Group.

**Temporary Collaborator:** A person employed or otherwise contracted by a Sponsor for a temporary and fixed duration (e.g. intern, contractor). Their role must entail that they primarily work on the Electron framework and/or other responsibilities of the Working Group they wish to join.

*For additional definitions, see the [Governance README](https://github.com/electron/governance#definitions).*

## Working Group Membership

Any Temporary Collaborator can can be nominated as an Observer by their Sponsor for the Sponsor's associated Working Group.

Once an Observer is accepted into a Working Group, the duration of their contract shall be noted in their section of the Working Group's membership list. Once their contract concludes, they will lose their Observer status, but are welcome to request to join the Working Group as an independent contributor.

Note that Working Groups may specify additional restrictions for Observers in their charters (e.g. restriction on voting rights for Working Group decisions).

## Permissions

As a Working Group Observer, the Temporary Collaborator would be given the access that membership in that Working Group grants, but only for the duration of their contract and under the strict supervision of the Sponsor.

This means they would be granted Full User access on Slack, and GitHub permissions in accordance with members of that Working Group. If their nominating party is the Chair, they would not be granted the extra permissions the Chair may have; only those of primary group members.

Observer-based access will be revoked at the end of their contract.
